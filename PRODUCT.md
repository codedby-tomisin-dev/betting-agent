## 🧠 1. The Spark
- **Problem:**  
  What pain or inefficiency sparked this idea?
- **Who feels it:**  
  (Audience segment, e.g., creators, freelancers, students, small businesses)
- **Why now:**  
  (Market trend, new tech, cultural moment, platform shift)
- **Existing alternatives:**  
  (How people currently solve this)

---

## 🚀 2. Core Idea
- **The “aha” insight:**  
  (What’s different / unique here?)
- **Key experience / loop:**  
  Describe the core user action that creates value.
- **MVP version:**  
  What’s the smallest version that still delivers the “aha”?  
  *(What can be built in 2–4 weeks?)*

## 🧩 3. Product Flow
> Think like a builder here — flow + logic.

- **User Journey (summary):**
  1. Discover →  
  2. Onboard →  
  3. Use core feature →  
  4. Retain / return

- **System Flow:**
  ```text
  [User] → [Frontend App / PWA] → [API] → [Database] → [Analytics/Event Bus]
  ```
- **Data model (optional):**
  ```text
  User
   ├── id
   ├── name
   └── linked_entities (cards, pages, etc.)
  ```

- **Key screens / modules:**
  - Landing / Onboarding
  - Core interaction
  - Analytics / Dashboard
  - Sharing / Network effect touchpoint

---

## 💰 4. Economics
- **Target user / segment:**  
  (e.g., “solo creators earning <$10k/mo online”)
- **Pricing hypothesis:**  
  - Freemium / Subscription / Transactional?
  - Example: `$5/month per creator` or `2% fee on sales`
- **Revenue flywheel:**  
  How do users → bring more users → increase value?
- **Unit economics:**  
  CAC ≈ ?  
  LTV ≈ ?  
  Payback period ≈ ?
- **Cost structure:**  
  Infra, hosting, distribution, support, etc.

---

## 🌍 5. Market & Moat
- **Market size / opportunity:**  
  (Optional but useful — TAM/SAM/SOM or qualitative)
- **Competitive landscape:**  
  - Competitors / analogs  
  - Key differentiators
- **Moat type:**  
  - Network, Brand, Data, Execution speed, or Switching cost?

---

## 📈 6. Growth Engine
- **Acquisition:**  
  (How do people hear about it? e.g., word-of-mouth, SEO, social, collabs)
- **Activation:**  
  (How do they hit the first “wow” moment?)
- **Retention:**  
  (Why do they stay?)
- **Virality loop:**  
  (What action inherently spreads it?)
- **Revenue expansion:**  
  (How do they pay more over time?)

---

## 🧱 7. Architecture / Stack Notes
> Outline like a senior engineer.

- **Frontend:** (React / Next.js / PWA / Flutter)
- **Backend:** (Django / FastAPI / Firebase / Supabase)
- **Infra / DevOps:** (Vercel / Render / AWS)
- **Integrations:** (Stripe, Clerk, Supabase Auth, etc.)
- **Data & Analytics:** (PostHog / Mixpanel / custom events)

---

## 🧠 8. Mental Model / Philosophy
> Your thinking behind the product — why it matters.

- Core principle driving the design:
  - e.g., “Ownership for creators should be frictionless.”
- Product philosophy:
  - e.g., “Every interaction should feel magical, not mechanical.”

---

## 🎯 9. Roadmap / Execution Plan
- **Phase 1:** MVP (2–4 weeks)
- **Phase 2:** Early adopters & feedback loop
- **Phase 3:** Network effect & virality features
- **Phase 4:** Monetization & scaling

---

## 🧩 10. Open Questions / Risks
- What don’t we know yet?
- Dependencies / tech unknowns
- Adoption risks or legal issues
